# Chameleon redesign

## What to build

A replicated key-value store on Raft with single-key reads and writes. Clients do not choose a consistency level per request. Each application registers SLAs, and the server decides what level to actually deliver, upgrading above the application's floor when the value of doing so exceeds the capacity it consumes. All decisions are server side.

There are no operating modes. Nothing switches between normal and pressure behavior. There is no global latency threshold and no batch-average latency check. Degradation under load is produced by a price that rises, not by a mode that flips.

## Consistency levels

MongoDB style.

Reads: eventual-local, eventual-majority, causal-local, causal-majority, linearizable.

Local means the replica's log, which may contain uncommitted entries that a leader change can roll back. Majority means committed state. That distinction is real and must be stated in any writeup, because a reader assuming stock Raft will assume followers only apply committed entries.

Causal-local waits until the local log index reaches the client's uncommitted session index. Causal-majority waits until the commit index reaches the client's committed session index. Linearizable is leader-only.

Implement linearizable with ReadIndex, not with a no-op append and not as an entry. The leader records its commit index, confirms leadership via a heartbeat round with a majority, waits for its applied index to reach the recorded value, then serves locally. No log entry is created, and reads batch onto whatever AppendEntries round is already in flight. Consider follower linearizable reads (follower obtains the read index from the leader, waits for its own apply to catch up) as a way to relieve leader concentration.

Writes: wc:1 through wc:majority.

## SLA format

An application registers one or more SLAs. An SLA can be either for read or write and is a set of rungs, each a triple (consistency requirement, end-to-end latency threshold in milliseconds, profit). Rungs are not ordered by anything; the structure below handles any shape. A request will have an application ID and which SLA applies. This is what lets one application have a cheap path and an expensive path.

## Protocol

Request carries: application id, SLA id, operation (read or write, key, value), the client's committed session index, the client's uncommitted session index, and the client's current RTT estimate to this server. It does not carry a consistency level, a deadline, or any profit values.

Send the RTT rather than a pre-subtracted budget, because the SLA has several thresholds and the server subtracts from each.

Send both committed and uncommitted session indices, not one. Causal-local checks against the uncommitted index; causal-majority checks against the committed index. Folding them together means a wc:1 acknowledgment at an uncommitted index makes every later causal-majority read wait for an index that may never commit.

Response carries: the value or acknowledgment, the level actually delivered, which rung was satisfied, the node's current log index, the node's current commit index, and the server-side service time.

The service time is required. Clients estimate RTT by subtracting it from observed end-to-end latency, using replies that involved no waiting. Without it the RTT estimate absorbs server-side work and inflates under load, which is exactly backwards.

## Server state

Per node: Raft log index and commit index; a histogram of service times per (level, gap bucket); an occupancy accumulator; the shadow price lambda; the registered SLA tables.

Leader only: the replication rate bucket.

There is no pool and no leader-side control state beyond that bucket. Leaders and followers run the identical algorithm and differ only in which levels are legal and which resources they hold.

## Resource model

Two resources, priced separately.

Replication is a rate. Every write costs one log entry. Reads cost zero, including linearizable reads, since ReadIndex appends nothing. Budget it at the measured maximum commit rate in entries per second, refill each second, charge at admission, never return. This lives at the leader only, since all entries originate there, and in practice it gates writes only.

Raft replication uses one persistent ordered bidirectional gRPC stream from the leader to each follower. The leader pipelines disjoint batches with separate confirmed and speculative cursors, advances `matchIndex` only on an ordered acknowledgement, and bounds each follower by `maxInflightReplicationBatchesPerFollower`. A rejection, stream failure, term change, or leadership change invalidates the speculative suffix and restarts from the last confirmed prefix. `maxEntriesPerReplicationBatch` bounds each stream message.

Occupancy is slot-time. Every request holds a slot from admission to reply, including time spent waiting on an index, a confirmation round, or replication acknowledgments. The cost of a level is its expected service time in milliseconds. Budget S_max at the concurrency where latency starts bending upward on a load sweep, not at a hard resource ceiling, so that utilization can exceed 1 and give the controller signal. Keep a genuine hard cap at roughly 1.5 times S_max as an immediate backstop. Occupancy is per node; followers have this and not the replication bucket.

## Request path

### Step 1: timestamp

Take `t_recv` the moment the request comes off the socket, before parsing and before it enters any queue. Use a monotonic clock. Everything downstream measures from here, and taking it later attributes queueing delay to the network, which makes clients conclude the network slowed down every time the server got busy.

### Step 2: determine the legal level set

Filter the ladder by this node's role and the operation type. In other words, followers can't take write requests. If the request is illegal here, redirect rather than reject.

Look up the SLA by (application id, SLA id). Reads use a read SLA, writes use a write SLA.

### Step 3: compute the index gap for every legal level

For each legal level `c`, compute the gap it must close before it can be served:

- eventual-local, eventual-majority: gap is zero, both values are already local
- causal-local: `gap = client_uncommitted_index - local_log_index`
- causal-majority: `gap = client_committed_index - commit_index`
- linearizable and write concerns: no gap dimension, they wait on rounds rather than indices

Bucket the gap coarsely based on the maximum batch size, for example into buckets for `gap <= 0`, `1..2000`, `2001..20000`, `> 20000`. Everything at or below zero lands in the same bucket, whose observed waits are near zero, so the case where an upgrade is free emerges from measured data rather than from a special rule.

The histogram cell `H[c][gap_bucket]` is now the price of level `c` for this request. Its CDF gives expected profit in step 4, its running mean gives occupancy cost.

### Step 4: score every legal level

Do this per level, independently. Symbols: the SLA is a set of rungs `r_j = (kappa_j, delta_j, pi_j)`, meaning consistency requirement, end-to-end latency threshold in milliseconds, and profit. `rho` is the client's RTT estimate from the request. `F_c` is the CDF of `H[c][gap_bucket]`, so `F_c(x)` is the fraction of recent executions of level `c` at this gap that finished within `x` milliseconds. `omega_c` is that cell's running mean, the occupancy cost in milliseconds. `lambda` is the current shadow price in profit per millisecond, initialized to zero. When a cell has no samples, treat the level as free and certain: omega_c = 0 and F_c(x) = 1 everywhere. Cap the number of requests concurrently riding an uncalibrated cell at a small number, since samples arrive only on completion.

**4a. Restrict to satisfiable rungs.** `R(c) = { j : c is at least as strong as kappa_j }`. A level satisfies its own rungs and every weaker one, which is why stronger levels can earn more.

**4b. Convert thresholds to the server's clock.** For each `j` in `R(c)`, set `d_j = delta_j - rho`. Discard any rung with `d_j <= 0`; the network alone already consumed that budget.

**4c. Sort and deduplicate.** Sort survivors by threshold ascending to get `d_(1) <= d_(2) <= ... <= d_(k)` with profits `pi_(1) ... pi_(k)`. Set `d_(0) = 0`.

**4d. Suffix maximum.** `M_i = max{ pi_(i), ..., pi_(k) }`, with `M_(k+1) = 0`.

Use the maximum rather than `pi_(i)` because beating a tight threshold means beating every looser one, so the request claims the best-paying rung among all it satisfied. This also keeps the formula correct for SLAs where a looser rung happens to pay more. Collapse identical thresholds to one entry holding the suffix max; duplicates otherwise produce empty intervals that contribute nothing.

**4e. Expected profit.**

```
E_c = sum over i of  M_i * ( F_c(d_(i)) - F_c(d_(i-1)) )
```

Implement the equivalent by-parts form, which needs only `k` CDF lookups and no differencing:

```
E_c = sum over i of  ( M_i - M_(i+1) ) * F_c(d_(i))
```

Read `F_c` from the cached prefix-sum array, interpolating linearly within the bucket that contains `d_(i)`.

**4f. Score.**

```
V_c = E_c - lambda * omega_c
```

`E_c` is expected profit, `omega_c` is milliseconds of slot time, `lambda` converts one into the other, so `V_c` is net profit after paying for the capacity the level consumes.

**4g. Choose.** `c* = argmax over legal c of V_c`.

Worked example, for testing. SLA rungs (linearizable, 150, 10), (causal-majority, 150, 6), (causal-majority, 400, 4), (eventual, 400, 1), (eventual, 150, 5), with `rho = 20`, so server-side thresholds are 130 and 380. After 4a through 4d: eventual collapses to 130 to 5 and 380 to 1; causal-majority to 130 to 6 and 380 to 4; linearizable to 130 to 10 and 380 to 4. With `F_eventual(130) = 0.99, F(380) = 1.00, omega = 2`; `F_cm(130) = 0.90, F(380) = 0.99, omega = 40`; `F_lin(130) = 0.70, F(380) = 0.97, omega = 80`, the expected profits are 4.96, 5.76, and 8.08. At `lambda = 0.02` the scores are 4.92, 4.96, and 6.48, so linearizable wins. At `lambda = 0.08` they are 4.80, 2.56, and 1.68, so eventual wins. Nothing switched modes; the price moved.

### Step 5: admit or reject, and charge

Reject if `max over c of V_c <= 0`. Nothing is worth what it would consume at the current price. This is the admission control: under light load `lambda` is near zero and nothing is refused, under overload `lambda` rises and the least valuable requests are shed first, in value order rather than arrival order.

Reject also on the two hard backstops, which exist to cover model error and react within a single request rather than within a control interval: no free occupancy slot against the hard cap, or an empty replication bucket for a write.

On admission, decrement the replication bucket if the request is a write, and open an occupancy slot by updating the accumulator:

```c
// per worker thread; sum A across workers at the interval boundary
long A     = 0;        // accumulated request-microseconds
int  n     = 0;        // requests currently in flight
long tLast = now();

void on_event(int delta) {      // +1 on admit, -1 on reply
    long t = now();
    A += (long)n * (t - tLast); // close out the stretch that just ended
    n += delta;
    tLast = t;
}
```

Call `on_event(+1)` here. No sampling is involved: the code that changes `n` is the code that records how long the previous value lasted.

### Step 6: execute

Wait for whatever the chosen level requires, then read or apply. Eventual levels wait for nothing. Causal levels wait for the relevant index to advance. Linearizable waits for a leadership confirmation round, and on a follower additionally for its own applied index to reach the read index. Write concerns wait for the required number of acknowledgments.

These are execution mechanics, not decision points. The decision was made in step 4 and is not revisited.

Bound the wait by the loosest server-side threshold computed in step 4b. If it expires, abandon the wait, fall back to the strongest level that needs no waiting, and serve immediately. A request that waits past every threshold will deliver zero profit whatever it does, so continuing to hold a slot for it is pure loss.

### Step 7: grade after the fact

Determine what was actually delivered, not what was targeted. Reads frequently satisfy a stronger level than the one chosen, and that profit is free.

For a read, take the returned value's index. If it is at or below the commit index, the majority rungs are satisfied as well as the local ones. If the replica turned out to be at or ahead of the client's session index, causal is satisfied even if eventual was executed.

Realized profit is the highest-profit rung whose consistency requirement the delivered result meets and whose threshold the total, service time plus `rho`, came in under.

Writes cannot be graded this way. Once acknowledged at wc:1 the decision is spent.

### Step 8: reply, release, record

Reply with the fields listed in the protocol section, including the measured service time `T = now() - t_recv`.

Call `on_event(-1)` to close the occupancy slot.

File the sample: in cell `H[c*][gap_bucket]`, where `c*` is the level actually executed and `gap_bucket` is the one it ran under, increment the bucket containing `T`, and add `T` to that cell's running sum and 1 to its running count. Three operations, no rebuild. Compute `omega` from the running sum over the running count, never from bucket midpoints.

Do not pre-aggregate samples per interval before filing them. Profit depends on which latency band the request lands in, so the distribution is the thing being used, and averaging first destroys it.

If the request abandoned its wait in step 6, file the sample into the cell of the level originally chosen, at the timeout value d_max, and file nothing under the fallback level, whose measured time is dominated by the abandoned wait and says nothing about what it costs.

## Background tasks

### Histogram refresh

Histogram cells use fixed geometric bucket edges, for example 64 buckets from 0.5 ms with ratio 1.15, so the bucket index for `x` is `floor(log(x/0.5)/log(1.15))` and no search is needed.

On each tick, multiply every bucket count, running sum, and running count by a decay factor around 0.95, then rebuild the prefix-sum array and publish it. Old observations fade geometrically, giving an effective memory of roughly `interval / (1 - decay)`, so 100 ms and 0.95 gives about 2000 ms; tune the decay for the memory you want.

Requests read the published snapshot and never block on the refresh. The snapshot is up to one tick stale, which is far below the estimate's own variance. With around 24 cells at 64 buckets a full sweep is about 1500 operations.

### Price controller, once per control interval

At the boundary, close out the final stretch of each worker's accumulator, sum them, and compute utilization:

```c
// tEnd is the interval boundary, T its length
A += (long)n * (tEnd - tLast);
tLast = tEnd;
double u = (double)A_summed_across_workers / ((double)S_max * T);
A = 0;
```

`u` is the time-weighted average number of requests in flight divided by `S_max`. Time weighting matters: a count of 10 held for 90 ms and 50 held for 10 ms averages to 14, not 30, and a boundary sample would have read 50.

Then update the price:

```
lambda <- max( lambda_min, lambda * exp( eta * ( u - u_target ) ) )
```

with `u_target` around 0.85, `eta` around 1, and `lambda_min` a small positive constant; 0.0001 works for rung profits on the order of 1 to 100. The floor does two jobs: it lets `lambda` start at zero, since the multiplicative update on its own would leave zero unchanged forever, and it stops `lambda` decaying so far during idle periods that recovery takes many intervals.

Multiplicative rather than additive because the right price spans orders of magnitude and because it can never go negative. A controller rather than a closed form because profit units are whatever the applications say they are, so a closed form would need a scale constant that is actually accurate. `lambda_min` is the one constant that remains, and it only has to be the right order of magnitude, since the controller finds the operating price from there.

Requests never read `u`. They read `lambda`, which is up to one interval stale by design, since a price recomputed per request would jitter and turn the ranking into noise. The hard occupancy cap in step 5 covers the fast timescale.

Compute `u` and `lambda` per node. Occupancy is local.

As a cross-check during development, the sum of service times of requests completing in the interval, divided by `S_max * T`, approximates the same quantity, with boundary bias when service times are comparable to the interval length.

## Write semantics

In Raft every accepted write takes the same replication path, so wc:1 and wc:majority are the same write imposing the same load. Only the moment of acknowledgment differs. A write upgrade therefore costs zero replication and pure occupancy, which is why a flat per-write cost would make write upgrades unconditional.

Holding the acknowledgment until majority commit closes the loss window, costs latency, and is gated by the SLA thresholds exactly like a read upgrade. That is the write upgrade.

An optional lower rung is acknowledging at wc:1 and letting the client learn later that the entry committed, from the commit index piggybacked on subsequent replies. This does not close the loss window, it only reports the outcome afterwards, so it is worth less and is semantically different. Note that a commit index alone confirms success but cannot detect failure, since a leader change can replace the entry at that index: detecting loss requires the acknowledgment to carry term and index together, and a check that the committed entry at that index still has the expected term. If that turns out to need per-session server state, drop this rung.

## Instrumentation to build in

Predicted versus realized profit per request, since profit now depends on a latency prediction and a misprediction is an accounting error, not just a missed deadline.

Fraction of upgrades that were free (gap at or below zero) versus waiting, swept against write load and key skew.

Per-level tail latency, not averages.

Which rung was satisfied, per request. This is the metric that makes a head-to-head against Pileus direct, since both systems consume the same declarative input.
