/**
 * Replicated key-value state machine with two views.
 *
 * The local view is applied when an entry is appended to the log and may roll
 * back on leader change; the committed view is applied when the commit index
 * advances and never rolls back. Eventual/causal-local reads serve from the
 * local view, majority-level reads from the committed view (MongoDB style
 * "local" vs "majority" read concerns on Raft).
 *
 * Every value carries the log index that last modified it. Step 7 of the
 * request path (grading after the fact) compares that index against the commit
 * index and the client's session indices to detect free upgrades.
 *
 * Thread safety: the maps are concurrent so reads never block, but all
 * mutations (apply*, rebuildLocal) must be called while holding the owning
 * ServerImpl's write lock, which is what orders them against log truncation
 * and commit-index advancement.
