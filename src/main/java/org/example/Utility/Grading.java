/**
 * Step 7: grade what was actually delivered, not what was targeted. Reads
 * frequently satisfy a stronger level than the one chosen, and that profit is
 * free.
 *
 * The graded strength is the strongest level on the ladder whose own
 * requirement the delivered result demonstrably meets. The executed level is
 * diagnostic rather than an automatic floor, except that a linearizable label
 * proves the ReadIndex mechanism that indices alone cannot reconstruct:
 *
 * - eventual-majority: the returned value's index is at or below the commit
 *   index, so the value is majority-committed (a committed-view read
 *   satisfies this by construction).
 * - causal-local: the view that served the value had reached the session's
 *   uncommitted anchor, so the session's acknowledged writes were visible.
 * - causal-majority: the value is committed and the committed view had
 *   reached the session's latest acknowledged write, the same uncommitted
 *   session anchor used by causal-local.
 * - linearizable: never grantable after the fact; it requires the leadership
 *   confirmation round that only the executed path performs.
 *
 * Realized profit is the highest-profit rung whose consistency requirement
 * the graded strength covers and whose threshold the total time, service time
 * plus rho, came in under. Writes cannot be upgraded this way (once
 * acknowledged the decision is spent), so their graded strength is simply the
 * replication count at acknowledgment.
